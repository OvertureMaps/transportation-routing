# Integration Approaches

## The Integration Challenge

Now that we understand both Valhalla's Mjolnir system and Overture's transportation schema, we face a key challenge: how do we integrate these two different worlds? How can we transform Overture's data into a format that Valhalla can use for routing?

This challenge is not unique to Valhallaâ€”any routing engine designed for OpenStreetMap data will require some form of adaptation to work with Overture data. In this chapter, we'll explore different approaches to this integration, with a particular focus on Valhalla.

## Understanding Valhalla's Pipeline

Before diving into integration approaches, let's review Valhalla's data processing pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[OSM PBF Data] --> B[PBFGraphParser]
    B --> C[OSMData]
    C --> D[GraphBuilder]
    D --> E[GraphTileBuilder]
    E --> F[Tile Storage]
    F --> G[Routing Engine]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

1. **PBFGraphParser**: Reads OSM PBF files and extracts nodes, ways, and relations
2. **OSMData**: In-memory representation of OSM entities
3. **GraphBuilder**: Transforms OSM entities into graph structures
4. **GraphTileBuilder**: Creates tile files with the graph data
5. **Tile Storage**: Stores tiles on disk in a hierarchical structure
6. **Routing Engine**: Uses tiles for path finding

Our goal is to insert Overture data into this pipeline at the appropriate point.

## Integration Approaches

We can identify several potential approaches for integrating Overture data with Valhalla:

### Approach 1: Convert to OSM Format

The most straightforward approach is to convert Overture data to OSM format (PBF or XML) and then use Valhalla's existing pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Conversion Tool]
    B --> C[OSM PBF Data]
    C --> D[Valhalla Pipeline]
    D --> E[Routing Graph]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

**Advantages:**
- Uses Valhalla's existing code without modifications
- Simplest to implement initially
- Benefits from Valhalla's mature OSM processing

**Disadvantages:**
- Loses Overture-specific advantages (explicit topology, structured attributes)
- May introduce inaccuracies in the translation
- Adds an extra processing step

### Approach 2: Create OSMData Directly

Instead of converting to OSM format files, we could create the in-memory `OSMData` structures directly from Overture data:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Custom Parser]
    B --> C[OSMData]
    C --> D[GraphBuilder]
    D --> E[Routing Graph]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

**Advantages:**
- Bypasses the PBF parsing step
- More direct control over the translation
- No intermediate file format

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires understanding Valhalla's internal `OSMData` structures
- Still constrained by OSM data model limitations
- Tightly coupled to Valhalla's implementation details

### Approach 3: Generate Binary Files for BuildEdges

A more efficient approach is to bypass both the PBF parsing and OSMData creation steps, and instead generate the binary files that Valhalla's `GraphBuilder::BuildEdges` function expects:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Transcoder]
    B --> C[ways.bin, nodes.bin, way_nodes.bin]
    C --> D[GraphBuilder::BuildEdges]
    D --> E[Routing Graph]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

**Advantages:**
- More efficient than previous approaches
- Bypasses OSM-specific processing
- Minimal changes to Valhalla's code

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires understanding Valhalla's binary file formats
- Still works within Valhalla's data model constraints
- Potential compatibility issues with future Valhalla versions

### Approach 4: Direct Integration with GraphBuilder

For even more control, we could modify Valhalla's `GraphBuilder` to work directly with Overture data:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Modified GraphBuilder]
    B --> C[Routing Graph]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

**Advantages:**
- Most direct approach
- Can fully leverage Overture's data model
- Potentially most efficient

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires significant modifications to Valhalla's code
- Creates a maintenance burden for keeping up with Valhalla updates
- Higher development complexity

### Approach 5: Custom Graph Tile Builder

The most ambitious approach is to create a custom graph tile builder specifically designed for Overture data:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Custom Tile Builder]
    B --> C[Overture Graph Tiles]
    C --> D[Converter]
    D --> E[Valhalla Tiles]
    E --> F[Routing Engine]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style F fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

**Advantages:**
- Fully optimized for Overture's data model
- Could support multiple routing engines
- Maximum flexibility and control

**Disadvantages:**
- Highest development effort
- Requires deep understanding of graph tile structures
- Needs converters for each target routing engine

## Recommended Approach: A Phased Strategy

Rather than choosing a single approach, we recommend a phased strategy that starts with simpler approaches and progressively moves toward more sophisticated ones:

### Phase 1: Generate Binary Files for BuildEdges (Approach 3)

For our initial implementation, we recommend generating the binary files that Valhalla's `GraphBuilder::BuildEdges` function expects. This approach offers a good balance of efficiency, control, and development effort.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Rust Transcoder]
    B --> C[ways.bin, nodes.bin, way_nodes.bin]
    C --> D[GraphBuilder::BuildEdges]
    D --> E[edges.bin]
    E --> F[GraphBuilder::Build]
    F --> G[Routing Graph]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

Key components of this approach:

1. **Rust Transcoder**: A custom tool that reads Overture data and generates Valhalla's binary files
2. **Entity Mapping**: Mapping between Overture entities and Valhalla structures
3. **Attribute Translation**: Converting Overture's structured attributes to Valhalla's format
4. **Integration Script**: Automating the process of running the transcoder and Valhalla's build pipeline

### Phase 2: Direct Integration and Research (Approach 4)

As we gain experience with Valhalla and Overture data, we can explore more direct integration by modifying Valhalla's `GraphBuilder` to work with in-memory structures created from Overture data.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Enhanced Integration Layer]
    B --> C[Modified GraphBuilder]
    C --> D[Routing Graph]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

In parallel, we'll research tile formats and design an Overture-specific tile format.

### Phase 3: Custom Graph Tiles (Approach 5)

In the long term, we aim to create a custom graph tile builder specifically designed for Overture data, with converters for multiple routing engines.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Overture Data] --> B[Overture Tile Builder]
    B --> C[Overture Graph Tiles]
    
    C --> D1[Valhalla Converter]
    C --> D2[OSRM Converter]
    C --> D3[GraphHopper Converter]
    
    D1 --> E1[Valhalla Routing]
    D2 --> E2[OSRM Routing]
    D3 --> E3[GraphHopper Routing]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

This phased approach allows us to deliver value quickly while working toward a more optimized long-term solution.

## Implementation Considerations

Regardless of the approach chosen, there are several important considerations for implementation:

### Data Processing Efficiency

Overture data can be large, so efficient processing is crucial:

- Use streaming processing where possible
- Implement parallel processing for independent tasks
- Optimize memory usage with appropriate data structures
- Consider incremental processing for updates

### Error Handling and Validation

Robust error handling and validation are essential:

- Validate Overture data against the schema
- Handle missing or invalid attributes gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Implement validation checks for the generated output

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Comprehensive testing ensures routing quality:

- Create test cases with known routes
- Compare results with expected outcomes
- Test with diverse geographic areas and road types
- Validate against real-world routing scenarios

### Documentation and Maintenance

Good documentation and maintenance practices are important:

- Document the mapping between Overture and Valhalla structures
- Explain implementation decisions and trade-offs
- Create clear instructions for users
- Plan for updates as both Overture and Valhalla evolve

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into the specific attribute mapping challenges and solutions for integrating Overture data with Valhalla.
