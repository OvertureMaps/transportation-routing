# Conclusion and Next Steps

## Summary of Mjolnir's Graph Tile Building Process

Throughout this book, we've explored the inner workings of Valhalla's Mjolnir component, which is responsible for converting OpenStreetMap data into Valhalla's tiled routing graph. Let's summarize the key aspects of this process:

1. **Data Parsing**: Mjolnir reads OSM data from PBF files, extracting nodes, ways, and relations.

2. **Tag Processing**: OSM tags are processed to determine road properties, access restrictions, speed limits, and other attributes.

3. **Graph Construction**: An initial graph is built with nodes at intersections and directed edges representing road segments.

4. **Graph Enhancement**: Additional attributes are added to the graph, such as turn lanes, speed limits, and administrative information.

5. **Hierarchical Graph Building**: Multiple levels of the graph are created, with higher levels containing only more important roads.

6. **Tile Creation**: The graph is divided into tiles for efficient storage and retrieval.

7. **Serialization**: Tiles are written to disk in a binary format optimized for quick loading.

8. **Special Features**: Complex features like turn restrictions, transit integration, and elevation data are handled.

9. **Performance Optimization**: Various techniques are used to efficiently process planet-scale data.

## Building Your Own Graph Tile Builder

If you're planning to build your own graph tile builder, consider these key aspects:

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Input Data Sources**: Decide which data sources your tile builder will support.
2. **Performance Requirements**: Consider the scale of data you need to process.
3. **Feature Support**: Determine which routing features you need to support.
4. **Integration Points**: Plan how your tile builder will integrate with other components.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a basic implementation that handles the core functionality.
2. **Incremental Development**: Add features one at a time, testing thoroughly as you go.
3. **Performance Profiling**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks early.
4. **Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation to ensure correctness.

### Key Components to Implement

1. **Data Parser**: Read and process input data.
2. **Graph Builder**: Construct the initial graph.
3. **Tile Creator**: Divide the graph into tiles.
4. **Serializer**: Write tiles to disk in the correct format.
5. **Hierarchy Builder**: Create multiple levels of the graph.
6. **Special Feature Handlers**: Implement support for turn restrictions, transit, etc.

## Extending Mjolnir

If you're interested in extending Mjolnir rather than building a new tile builder from scratch, consider these possibilities:

### Adding New Data Sources

Mjolnir currently focuses on OpenStreetMap data, but you could extend it to support other data sources:

```cpp
// Example of adding a new data source parser
class CustomDataParser {
public:
  CustomDataParser(const Config& config);
  
  // Parse custom data
  bool Parse(const std::vector<std::string>& input_files);
  
  // Get the parsed data
  const ParsedData& GetData() const;
  
private:
  // Parse different types of data
  void ParseNodes(const InputData& data);
  void ParseEdges(const InputData& data);
  
  // Store parsed data
  ParsedData parsed_data_;
};
```

### Adding New Features

You could extend Mjolnir to support new routing features:

```cpp
// Example of adding support for traffic data
class TrafficBuilder {
public:
  TrafficBuilder(const Config& config);
  
  // Build traffic data
  bool Build(const std::vector<std::string>& traffic_files);
  
private:
  // Process traffic data
  void ProcessTrafficData(const std::string& file);
  
  // Add traffic data to tiles
  void AddTrafficToTiles();
  
  // Configuration
  Config config_;
};
```

### Improving Performance

You could optimize Mjolnir for better performance:

```cpp
// Example of adding a more efficient spatial index
template <typename T>
class QuadTree {
public:
  QuadTree(const BoundingBox& bounds);
  
  // Insert an item
  void Insert(const T& item, const Point& point);
  
  // Query items within a bounding box
  std::vector<T> Query(const BoundingBox& bounds) const;
  
  // Nearest neighbor query
  std::vector<T> Nearest(const Point& point, size_t count) const;
  
private:
  // Internal implementation
  struct Node;
  std::unique_ptr<Node> root_;
  BoundingBox bounds_;
};
```

## Future Directions

As routing technology continues to evolve, there are several exciting directions for future development:

### Real-Time Updates

Implementing support for real-time updates would allow the graph to reflect current conditions:

```cpp
// Example of a real-time update system
class RealTimeUpdater {
public:
  RealTimeUpdater(const Config& config);
  
  // Apply real-time updates
  bool ApplyUpdates(const std::vector<Update>& updates);
  
private:
  // Update a specific tile
  bool UpdateTile(const GraphId& tile_id, const std::vector<Update>& updates);
  
  // Configuration
  Config config_;
};
```

### Machine Learning Integration

Machine learning could be used to improve various aspects of routing:

```cpp
// Example of using machine learning for speed prediction
class MLSpeedPredictor {
public:
  MLSpeedPredictor(const Config& config);
  
  // Load the model
  bool LoadModel(const std::string& model_file);
  
  // Predict speed for an edge
  float PredictSpeed(const EdgeFeatures& features) const;
  
private:
  // ML model
  std::unique_ptr<Model> model_;
  
  // Configuration
  Config config_;
};
```

### 3D Routing

Supporting 3D routing would enable more accurate navigation in complex environments:

```cpp
// Example of 3D routing support
class ThreeDBuilder {
public:
  ThreeDBuilder(const Config& config);
  
  // Build 3D data
  bool Build(const std::vector<std::string>& input_files);
  
private:
  // Process 3D data
  void Process3DData(const std::string& file);
  
  // Add 3D data to tiles
  void Add3DToTiles();
  
  // Configuration
  Config config_;
};
```

## Final Thoughts

Building a graph tile builder is a complex but rewarding task. By understanding how Mjolnir works, you can create your own implementation that meets your specific needs while remaining compatible with Valhalla's routing engine.

Remember that the key to a successful implementation is a deep understanding of the tile format, careful attention to detail in the graph building process, and thorough testing to ensure correctness and performance.

Whether you choose to build your own graph tile builder from scratch or extend Mjolnir, the insights from this book should provide a solid foundation for your work.

## Resources for Further Learning

To deepen your understanding of graph tile building and routing, consider these resources:

1. **Valhalla Documentation**: The official documentation at [valhalla.github.io/valhalla](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla) provides detailed information about Valhalla's components and APIs.

2. **OpenStreetMap Wiki**: The [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org) contains valuable information about OSM data and tagging conventions.

3. **Routing Algorithms**: Books like "Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven Skiena and "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein cover the fundamental algorithms used in routing.

4. **Spatial Indexing**: Papers on R-trees, quad trees, and other spatial indexing structures provide insights into efficient spatial queries.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Resources on C++ performance optimization, memory management, and parallel processing can help you build an efficient tile builder.

By combining the knowledge from this book with these additional resources, you'll be well-equipped to build a high-quality graph tile builder for routing applications.
