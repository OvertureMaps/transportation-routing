# Engineering Plan Outline: Overture to Valhalla Integration

Based on the PR comments and our analysis, here's an outline for a more narrative and diagram-driven engineering plan:

## 1. Introduction

- **Project Context**: Brief overview of Overture Maps Foundation and Valhalla routing engine
- **Problem Statement**: Need to create a routing solution using Overture Transportation Schema data
- **Approach**: Integration with Valhalla's pipeline at the appropriate stage rather than full fork
- **Goals**: Create a transcoder that converts Overture data to Valhalla's intermediate structures

## 2. Understanding the Data Ecosystems

- **Overture Transportation Schema**
  - Data model and key entities
  - Normalized attribute structure
  - Topological representation
  - GeoParquet format advantages
  
- **Valhalla's Data Requirements**
  - OSMData and related structures
  - Graph representation (nodes, edges)
  - Tile structure and hierarchy
  - Administrative boundaries

## 3. Integration Architecture

- **Valhalla Pipeline Overview**
  - Visual diagram of the complete pipeline
  - Identification of integration points
  - Rationale for choosing the `ConstructEdges` phase
  
- **Proposed Architecture**
  - System diagram showing data flow from Overture to Valhalla
  - Component breakdown of the transcoder
  - Integration with existing Valhalla tools

## 4. Data Mapping Strategy

- **Entity Mapping**
  - Overture segments → Valhalla edges
  - Overture connectors → Valhalla nodes
  - Detailed mapping tables with examples
  
- **Attribute Transformation**
  - Road classification mapping
  - Access restrictions
  - Speed limits and travel times
  - Special cases (turn restrictions, etc.)

## 5. Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1: Core Transcoder**
  - Basic structure conversion
  - Essential attribute mapping
  - Integration with Valhalla pipeline
  
- **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
  - Turn restrictions
  - Lane information
  - Time-dependent attributes
  
- **Phase 3: Optimization and Validation**
  - Performance improvements
  - Validation tools
  - Documentation and examples

## 6. Technical Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge 1: Schema Differences**
  - Detailed analysis of differences
  - Proposed mapping solutions
  
- **Challenge 2: Administrative Boundaries**
  - Approach for handling admin data
  - Integration with spatialite/DuckDB
  
- **Challenge 3: Performance Considerations**
  - Strategies for handling large datasets
  - Parallelization opportunities

## 7. Validation and Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing Approach**
  - Component-level tests
  - Data transformation validation
  
- **Integration Testing**
  - End-to-end pipeline tests
  - Comparison with expected outputs
  
- **Performance Benchmarking**
  - Metrics to track
  - Baseline comparisons

## 8. Future Directions

- **Potential Enhancements**
  - Additional transportation modes
  - Real-time data integration
  - Custom routing profiles
  
- **Maintenance Considerations**
  - Keeping up with Overture schema changes
  - Valhalla version compatibility

## 9. Conclusion

- **Summary of Approach**
- **Expected Benefits**
- **Next Steps**
