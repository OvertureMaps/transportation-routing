# Key Findings from PR Comments Analysis

After analyzing the PR comments and examining the relevant Valhalla code, here are the key findings that will guide our engineering plan:

## 1. Integration Approach

**Finding**: The most effective approach is to integrate at the `ConstructEdges` phase of Valhalla's pipeline.

**Evidence**:
- Kevin Kreiser specifically recommends this approach: "the key to making compatible data for valhalla then is to simply find the stage where you can generate that intermediate data. in this case that stage is either the `ConstructEdges` phase or the `GraphBuilder` stage. i personally think the former is both ideal and highly plausible."
- Code examination confirms that `ConstructEdges` takes an `OSMData` structure as input, which has a well-defined interface.
- This approach minimizes the amount of Valhalla code that needs to be modified.

**Implication**: We should focus on creating a transcoder that converts Overture data to the `OSMData` structure expected by `ConstructEdges`.

## 2. Target Data Structures

**Finding**: We need to map Overture data to several key Valhalla structures: `OSMData`, `OSMWay`, `OSMNode`, and `OSMWayNode`.

**Evidence**:
- Kevin explicitly lists these structures: "you need to write a transcoder from overture into these fixed size structures (`OSMData`, `OSMWay`, `OSMNode`, `OSMWayNode`, and a few others etc) that `ConstructEdges` expects."
- Code examination shows these structures are central to Valhalla's data model.
- `OSMData` contains collections of the other structures and is the main input to `ConstructEdges`.

**Implication**: Our transcoder needs to create these structures from Overture data, mapping Overture's segments and connectors to Valhalla's ways and nodes.

## 3. Advantages of Overture

**Finding**: Overture's data model has several advantages that could simplify integration.

**Evidence**:
- Kevin notes: "topological nodes are first class citizens in overture"
- Kevin also mentions: "overture it should be already 'normalized' (ie there is only one tagging variant of a particular attribute/concept that the parser has to care about)"
- Kevin adds: "the spatial nature of geoparquet makes processing (tile cutting) easier"

**Implication**: We can leverage these advantages in our transcoder, particularly the normalized schema and first-class topological nodes.

## 4. Administrative Boundaries

**Finding**: Administrative boundaries require special handling.

**Evidence**:
- Kevin mentions: "the only other thing you need is a means of getting the admin boundary information into a spatialite db"
- Code examination shows Valhalla uses a spatialite database for admin boundaries.
- Kevin suggests: "that might be somewhat easy with something like duckdb and its many hookins for standardized spatial formats"

**Implication**: We need a separate process to convert Overture's admin boundary data to a spatialite database format that Valhalla can use.

## 5. Attribute Mapping Complexity

**Finding**: Mapping between Overture's attributes and Valhalla's expected attributes will be complex but manageable.

**Evidence**:
- Rob mentions having "attribute parsing working in what I would describe as an 'insane' way"
- Rob suggests simplification: "I don't think I need to support all the values I am now"
- Kevin acknowledges: "the biggest struggle is just doing all the attribute parsing in a sane way"
- Code examination shows `OSMWay` has numerous attributes that need to be populated.

**Implication**: We should start with essential attributes for basic routing and add support for additional attributes incrementally.

## 6. Avoiding Full Fork

**Finding**: We should avoid creating a full fork of Mjolnir.

**Evidence**:
- Rob expresses concern: "we are essentially building out Mjolnir itself. It would be essentially useless to anyone with that custom fork."
- Kevin's suggested approach minimizes the need for forking by targeting a specific integration point.
- Code examination confirms that integrating at `ConstructEdges` would require minimal changes to Valhalla's codebase.

**Implication**: Our approach should focus on creating a standalone transcoder rather than modifying Valhalla's core code.

## 7. Existing Work

**Finding**: Rob has already implemented attribute parsing for Overture data for the Esri routing engine.

**Evidence**:
- Rob states: "I currently have attribute parsing working in what I would describe as an 'insane' way and got the output of that working in the Esri routing engine."

**Implication**: We should coordinate with Rob to understand his approach and potentially leverage his work for our Valhalla integration.

## 8. Incremental Approach

**Finding**: An incremental approach to implementation is recommended.

**Evidence**:
- Kevin suggests: "going deep on the integration point between overture and valhalla is more important than breadthwise exploring how valhalla works. that can wait until we have something sort of working."
- Rob mentions: "I think I could simplify the way I am doing it though, I don't think I need to support all the values I am now."

**Implication**: We should focus first on a minimal viable integration that supports basic routing, then incrementally add more features and optimizations.
