# Context Folder - Complete Project Summary

This folder contains comprehensive context information and expert analysis for the OMF-Bifrost project, which converts Overture Maps Foundation transportation data to Valhalla routing engine format.

## Project Overview

**OMF-Bifrost** is a Rust-based transcoder that bridges Overture Maps Foundation's transportation data with Valhalla's routing engine. The project aims to enable routing on Overture data without requiring conversion back to OSM PBF format.

### Current Status
- **Rust project structure**: âœ… Complete (Issue #9 mostly done)
- **Binary format analysis**: âœ… Complete (Issue #6) - See detailed analysis below
- **Binary file writers**: ðŸ”„ Ready to implement (Issue #11)

## Key Technical Insights

### Integration Strategy
Based on expert feedback from Kevin Kreiser (Valhalla core developer), the optimal approach is:

1. **Target Integration Point**: `ConstructEdges` phase of Valhalla's pipeline
2. **Avoid Full Fork**: Create a standalone transcoder rather than forking Mjolnir
3. **Data Structure Focus**: Convert Overture data to `OSMData`, `OSMWay`, `OSMNode`, and `OSMWayNode` structures
4. **Administrative Boundaries**: Separate process to convert admin data to spatialite format

### Valhalla Pipeline Integration
```
OSM PBF â†’ Parse OSM â†’ OSMData â†’ ConstructEdges â†’ GraphBuilder â†’ Tiles
Overture â†’ [Our Transcoder] â†—
```

### Advantages of Overture for Routing
- Topological nodes are first-class citizens
- Normalized schema (no tagging variants)
- GeoParquet format simplifies tile cutting
- Better structured than OSM for routing applications

## Expert Analysis Summary

### Kevin Kreiser's Key Recommendations
- Focus on `ConstructEdges` integration point over broad Valhalla exploration
- Leverage Overture's normalized schema and first-class topological nodes
- Start with essential attributes, add complexity incrementally
- Use DuckDB for admin boundary processing to spatialite format

### Rob Haley's Concerns & Insights
- Avoid creating a custom Mjolnir fork that's unusable by others
- Has working attribute parsing for Overture â†’ Esri routing engine
- Suggests focusing on core modes/maneuvers we can support well
- Recommends simplifying attribute mapping approach

### Technical Challenges Identified
1. **Attribute Mapping**: Complex but manageable with incremental approach
2. **Subsegment Attributions**: Potential overlapping issues to address
3. **Schema Differences**: Overture vs OSM attribute parsing
4. **Administrative Data**: Requires separate spatialite database creation

## Current GitHub Issues

1. **Issue #6**: Valhalla Binary Format Analysis (Research) - âœ… **COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Analyzed ways.bin, nodes.bin, way_nodes.bin formats
   - âœ… Documented OSMWay, OSMNode, OSMWayNode structures  
   - âœ… Created technical specification for binary compatibility
   - âœ… Provided C++ and Rust sample code for reading/writing

2. **Issue #9**: Rust Project Setup (Setup) - âœ… Mostly Complete
   - Project structure, dependencies, CI/CD, documentation

3. **Issue #11**: Binary File Writer Implementation (Implementation) - ðŸ”„ **READY TO START**
   - Implement OSM* structure serialization using analysis from Issue #6
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Build validation tools for Valhalla compatibility

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Implement Issue #11**: Build the core binary file writers using the detailed analysis from Issue #6
2. **Incremental Testing**: Start with basic routing, add complexity gradually
3. **Admin Boundary Processing**: Separate tool for spatialite database creation
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate with ConstructEdges and full Valhalla pipeline

## Binary Format Analysis Summary (Issue #6 Complete)

### Key Findings
- **Simple Format**: Direct C++ struct serialization, no headers/metadata
- **Native Endianness**: Platform-specific, no byte swapping
- **Three Files**: ways.bin (OSMWay), way_nodes.bin (OSMWayNode), nodes.bin (output)
- **Coordinate Encoding**: 7-digit precision with offset encoding
- **Index Relationships**: way_nodes.bin references ways.bin via way_index

### Critical Implementation Details
- **OSMWay**: ~200 bytes, contains way attributes and node count
- **OSMWayNode**: ~50 bytes, contains full OSMNode + way references  
- **Coordinate Formula**: `encoded = round((coord + offset) * 1e7)`
- **Validation Required**: File sizes, index consistency, coordinate validity

### Ready for Implementation
All technical specifications, sample code, and validation requirements are documented in the `/notes/` directory. Issue #11 can now proceed with confidence.

## Key Success Factors

- Focus on integration point rather than broad Valhalla understanding
- Leverage Overture's advantages (normalized schema, first-class nodes)
- Maintain compatibility with Valhalla's existing pipeline
- Avoid creating unusable custom forks
- Coordinate with existing work (Rob's attribute parsing experience)
